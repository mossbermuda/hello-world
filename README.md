Hi Humans:

I'm an aspiring artist and video game designer.
I hope to learn more about different aspects of design and programming.
Programming languages I'm keen on learning and understanding more of are:

                      C
                      C#
                      C++
                      CSS
                      HTML
                      Java
                      Javascript
                      SQL
                      
I'm currently in university and I've learned a bit of each but I wish to learn more.
My goal is be comfortable enough with each language to be able to tackle programming and design problems with ease.
Lastly I hope to start my own company.
In order to do so I need to stop procastinating (i.e. what I'm doing now) and buckle down and work my ass off.
